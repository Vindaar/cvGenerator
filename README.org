* cvGenerator

Tired of using tools as slow as molasses for your CV? Or hate dealing
with LaTeX directly? And you already use Emacs and Org mode?

Then this might be the thing for you.

The uninspiringly named ~cvGenerator~ is a simple library, which uses
Org mode files as data sources, parses them and then produces a LaTeX
based CV. For the time being we fill the [[https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV][AltaCV]] template, but I might
add other templates too.

I'll provide some more explanation and examples soon.
